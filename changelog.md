# v1.0.0 - 25-09-2024

**Initial Release**

Introducing a new feature in React that allows developers to render part of a component in a new browser tab or window. This functionality is particularly useful for displaying large content across two related windows, enhancing the user experience when working with dual screens in extended mode. Ideal for scenarios where users need to view or interact with content simultaneously across multiple screens.
